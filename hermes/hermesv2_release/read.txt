Hermes (Herpes) for Gayry's Mod

I no longer care about this and care about garry's mod, so im better off giving it out to you guyz
so you can use it.

gmcl_hermes does shit like scriptenforcer bypassens, nospread, and other useless bullshit

files:
	__autoload__ - put this in garrysmod/garrysmod (no it does not go in the lua folder faggots)
	autorun & menu_plugins - put this shit in garrysmod/garrysmod/lua
	gmcl_hermes - this is da main module put it in garrysmod/garrysmod/includes/modules

in case I forget, if the module is crashing you change these interfaces:
VMaterialSystem079 to 080
VFileSystem017 to 019
